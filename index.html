		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p><a href="http://https://www.salvationarmy.org.au/">The Salvation Army Australia</a>, or Salvos in Australian English, is an international Christian movement known for its <a href="http://https://www.salvationarmy.org.au/about-us/our-services/">charity work</a>.
			Across Australia – in cities, country towns and rural communities – their work touches every demographic and age group.  
			They are involved in national issues while also bringing hope to people who may be experiencing hardship or injustice.</p>

		<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
		<h4 id="secondary-research">Secondary Research: Online Ethnography</h4>
			<p>Secondary research, or desk reserach, is a research that was previously conducted by someone else. 
			<b>Online ethnography</b> was conducted here specifically to get a better understanding of the problem space around Salvation Army. 
			It was also selected as the choice of method because it is cost-effective and accessible. 
			At this point we want to cast the net in a wide area to explore the domain. This will help us ask more relevant questions in the later primary research stage.</p>
			<p>We have decided to conduct the research on Reddit, specifically in the r/Australia thread. 
				This scopes down the context to only Australia and keywords that we used were <i>Salvation Army</i> and <i>Salvos</i>.</p>
			<p>Here are some quotes from online users:</p>	
				<ul id="online-ethnography-quotes">
					<li>
						<strong>"The majority of the stuff, like 60%, that gets donated doesn’t actually make it to the floor.</strong> 
						Clothing gets recycled but the rest goes to the tip <i>(slang word for Garbage Dump)</i> leading to pretty high garbage disposal costs."
					</li>
				</br>
					<li>
						"Don’t know about others. But we try to sell everything we can. 
						Depending on the area, about 75% of the funds raised goes to food (coles/woolies gift cards). 
						If you (referring to people who requires help) get in touch with the welfare side, you could get free store gift cards.
						Everything that we can't sell, either because its broken, poor quality, or for insurance reasons. 
						<strong>They go the bin.</strong>
					</li>
				</br>
					<li>
						"<strong>We also don't sell food, and we don't get enough or regularly to set up a official process for them.</strong> 
						They are usually left in the tea room for whoever’s hungry, but the majority of it gets binned since they tend to be expired." 
					</li>
				</br>
					<li>
						"Throwing stuff away is a pain as well because <strong>the bins costs about 1-2 days worth of sales revenues per week.</strong> 
							So thats 15-30% of sales just for the bins, and we are lucky being in good neighborhood."
					</li>
				</br>
					<li>
						"I would say about 50-60%+ plus of the cloth received gets exported <strong>(and maybe 5-10% into the bins directly).</strong> 
						But thats for my store where the quality threshold is probably a bit higher than others since we do get a lot coming through. 
						The stuff that gets exported are typically really worn, unwashed, missing buttons etc. 
						Then the even worse ones go the bins directly."
					</li>
				</br>
					<li>
						"<strong>Bins cost us money.</strong>"
					</li>	
				</br>
					<li>
						"The issue is that we simply <strong>don't have the manpower to process everything more thoroughly, and no one to buy them.</strong> 
						The percentage of sale-able items vs rubbish can also get pretty bad at times."
					</li>
				</br>
					<li>
						"if we look at the daily sales vs the amount of volunteer man-hours, <strong>we won't have the sales to cover even half or even quarter of minimum wage if the positions were paid.</strong>"
					</li>

				</br>
					<li>
						"The Salvos in my area have had to put security fences around the stores so that people can only drop off during business hours as the <strong>disposal costs were too high.</strong>"
					</li>
				</ul>

		<h4 id="secondary-research">Online Ethnography Conclusion</h4>
				<p>The findings shows that donations made at the op-stores are causing a lot of manpower and disposal cost issues.
					People aren't aware of the existing donation guidelines put in place because of insurance and safety issues. 
					My assumptions are that donators are not putting much thought to sorting out unwanted items for donation.
					They might be also uneducated on these guidelines and backend work processes of sorting and filtering of their donations.  
				</p>
				<p>With these new insights, we now have a better idea of where to lead the next stage of primary research.</p>

		<h4 id="primary-research">Primary Research: Questionnaires</h4>
				<p>Primary research is a quick and effective research method to come up with valuable data.
				In this stage of research, we want to validate the assumptions made earlier and also to better understand our target audience.</p>
				<p>We decided to kick off with a Questionnaire to quickly get a general overview of our audience. 
					We asked question about <em>what they think or know about The Salvation Army, their donating experiences, and motivation for donating.</em></p>
			<h4 id="primary-research">Questionnaires Conclusion</h4>
			<p>The findings validated some of our prior assumptions. 
				The motivation for most donators is to actually <strong>get rid of stuff they have</strong>, while others just want to help people in general.
				We can also see that most of them have a <strong>misconception</strong> on what The Salvation Army does. </p>
			<p>They don't simply "Collect used goods" nor "Collect unwanted items to distribute to the needy". The store would instead sort and put out sellable items from donations bins, on to the ops-store. 
				And then use those profits made to help those in need through various services.
			</p>

				<figcaption>Questionnaire and Interview findings on a Miro Board</figcaption>
			</figure>

		<h4 id="primary-research">Primary Research: Interviews</h4>
			<p>We then did some follow up interviews with selected participants to get better insights into their donation motivation and process.
				We ask some questions like: "How was the donation process like for you?", "Where do you think your donated items go?","Do you know what can or cannot be donated?", "Are you aware of any donation guidelines for donating goods?" </p>
		<h4 id="primary-research">Interviews Conclusion</h4>
			<p>It seems like people only have superficial understanding of the donation guidelines: that the donation are good as long as it's clean and in good condition.
				However, there's an extensive <a href="Assets/Donation-guide-draft-1.pdf"> list</a> of what The Salvation Army cannot accept as donations. 
			</p>
			<p>From the primary and secondary researches, we can conlcude that people are generally very uneducated about the specifics of the donation guidelines. 
				If we can create a solution to educate donors, this will greatly help with the issues ops-stores are facing. 
				Both in reducing manpower to go though donations thoroughly, and the cost of bins disposal.
				This will help The Salvation Army with sales revenues from the donation bins, and that more funds would be raised to provide better and more charity services.
			</p>

		<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
		<p>Next we create user profiles to present key attributes of our users in an overview table. 
			These user profiles contain information about our users' behaviors and relevant attributes.
			And instead of providing specific user narratives description, the user profiles highlight key information and present them as a range or trend.
			These profiles are not static and are subjected to refinemenet through the iterative stage of the design process.</p>
			<div id="user-profiles">
				<figure>
					<img src="Assets/mk-profile.jpg" alt="user profile of a homeowner." />
					<figcaption>A user profile of a homeowner who wants to get rid of stuff but is lazy to transport them.</figcaption>

					<figcaption>An user journey map of a homeowner to identify frustrations and opportunities in the donation process.</figcaption>
				</figure>
	
			</div>

			<p>Through journey mapping of the user profiles, we are presented with some opportunities. 
				For example, guides for users who are confused on whether certain goods are acceptable for donation; 
				Transport service for picking up bulky goods; Users can sign up for free boxes and bags to pack their donations.
				A map to locate donation bins around them.</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>All the aforementioned opportunities can be used to drive users to the website. By providing them value added services, 
					we can complete their user journey on the website with some infomation about Salvation Army's exisiting donation guidelines.
					When users leave our website, they would be more educated about the whole donation process and guidelines.
					And hopefully user can be more thoughtful on gathering their goods for donations, and also help cut wastage in the process.

		<h2>Ideation</h2>
		<p>With limited time and resources for this project, it is important to priortise which features to be put on the development roadmap.
			Hence we'll be using a matrix to select what are the deliverables for this website.
		</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="Assets/content-priortization.jpg" alt="content priortization matrix." />
			<figcaption>Content priortization matrix to select what are the more important features to be delivered.</figcaption>

		</figure>
		<p>So we decided to focus on 3 features for this current design sprint:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Donation guide to educate users on what are the acceptable donations.</li>
			<li>A map feature to show users where are the nearby donation bins.</li>
			<li>A feature for users to schedule pick up services for their bulky donations.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>

		<figure>
			<img src="Assets/moodboard-1.jpg" alt="moodboard 1" />
			<img src="Assets/moodboard-2.jpg" alt="moodboard 2" />
			<figcaption>Moodboards for ideation.</figcaption>

		</figure>

		<p>Before starting on ideation, a moodboard was created to get an idea or feel on what we want for the website. 
			Some ideas include dropping <strong>bite sized information</strong> alongside the <strong>map features</strong>, 
			and <strong>a pick up service feature</strong> where users can scedule a timeslot for Salvation Army to come pick up the bulky items for a small fee.
		</p>

		<p>And as such, we have also created an Information Architecture diagram that encompasses all the aforementioned features to show an overview of the website.</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="Assets/information-architecture.jpg" alt="information architecture diagram" />
			<figcaption>Information Architecture for the proposed website</figcaption>

		<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
		<p>Some quick sketches were done based on the content from our IA diagram.</p>

		</div>
	</section>

	<section id="designs">
		<h2>Designs</h2>
		<p>After sketching, we will create wireframes and mockups based on selected ideas. 
			The wireframes give us a better overview of our ideas with all empty placeholders and other design elements. 
			This are made with lesser effort than the final mockup and serves to help visually represent the website's structure. 
		</p>

		<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
		<p>Wireframes for each product feature is drawn up with Figma. These are design placeholders, done without much visual details like colors and typography.
			This process also greatly helps with describing the functionality of the site as well as the relationship between each screens.
		</p>

		<h4 id="landing-pages">Wireframes: Landing Pages</h4>
		<p>For the landing pages, we want the features to be immediately accessible when user enter the website.
			Hence all the Call-to-actions(CTA) are placed <strong>above the fold </strong> <em>(upper half of the front page)</em> intentionally.
			Apart from the rule above, the landing page layouts are just variation of element placements. 
		</p>
		<p>Also note the black tab on the global navigation represents bite size informations, that will help educate users on some interesting or unexpected fact on the donation process or guide.
			The information will be updated randomly like a playlist on shuffle. 
			Users can then click on it to see more and perhaps check out other facts.
		</p>

				<figure>

					<figcaption>Pop out to ask for user's current location or address.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>When users click on the CTA to find nearby donation bins, the pop out will ask for the user's address.
					User can also allow the website to use their current location to find the nearest bin.
				</p>	
									
				<p>In the subsequent wireframes, we can see the details of donation bins' location being displayed differently.
					In the first one, the site will highlight the bin that is nearest to the user as well as showing condensed information about the other nearby bins.
					In the second wireframe, only the information of the selected location is displayed. This could help with preventing an information overload for the user but the lack of information could also serve some issue with navigating.
				</p>
				<p>But the assumption made here is that since users already entered their current location in the previous pop-out, is there any other reasons for them to be aware of the addresses of other bins.
				</p>

				<h4 id="pick-up">Wireframes: Scheduling a pick up service</h4>
				<p>This feature is for people who needs help transporting bulky items. 
				They can then schedule a time and day for The Salvation Army to pick up the items from them.
				However there's a lack of reasearch for this feature, we are unaware of the necessary details needed for sceduling.
				Do we need to account for the number of items? Or if specific time slot is preferred over the option to select a time range? 
				Also do we need to account for pick up charges? If so, does it differ for different locations?</p>

	<p>The mockups are then created from the best wireframe ideas, consisting of the website's MVP features.
		We have decided to use the two colors that represents The Salvation Army, sticking to their brand identity.
